# EsotericLanguages
Just fun projects in super duper random languages

#Why?

Because  I was challenged on friends discord to write hello world! in Ook! language (without copying someone's else's existing code). Being me and googling a little bit, decided to write that in Brainf*ck, and later convert to Ook! (essentially Ook! is just wrapper Brainf*ck).
