# EsotericLanguages
Just fun projects in super duper random languages

#Why?

Because today (2019-07-26) I was challenged on friends discord to write hello world! in Ook! language (without copying existing code). Being me and googling a little bit, decided to write that in Brainf*ck, and later convert to Ook! (essentially just wrapper for it). 1st attempt will just be pretty much brute force fast-dirty way
