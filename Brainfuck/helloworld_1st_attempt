Because in Brainf*ck everything other than very few symbols will be ignored ([]+-<>.,) - more info can be found on 
https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck, so will try to make it user friendly and write what i'm doing at the end of every line

What I will do ? Write "Hello, World!" in BF.  Including space,  comma and exclamation mark. So let's get down to ASCII numbers that I
will need :
H - 72
e - 101
l - 108
o - 111
W - 87
r - 114
d - 100
[space] - 32
, - 44
! - 33

+++++ +++ increase cell 0 to 8
[ while cell 0 not 0
>++++ go to cell 1 and increase value by 4
[ while cell 1 not 0
>+ increase cell 2 by 1 because guess where space and exclamation mark are going to come from
>+ increase cell 3 by 1 for comma
>++ increase cell 4 by 2 for letter H
>+++ increase cell 5 by 3 for letter W
>+++ increase cell 6 by 3 for e and d
>+++ increase cell 7 by 3 for l and o
>+++ increase cell 8 by 3 for r
<<<<<<<- decrease cell 1 by 1
]
>>+ go to cell 3 and increase by 1 so it is 32 plus 8 as end result
>+ cell 4 by one so 64 plus 8 = 72
>- cell 5 by 3 so 96 minus 1 = 88
>+ cell 6 by 1 so 96 plus 1 = 104
>+ cell 7 by 1 so 96 plus 8 = 104
>++ cell 8 by 2 so 96 plus 16 = 112
<<<<<<<<- decrease cell 0 by 1
]
>>>>. print letter H
>>---. print e
>++++.. print ll
+++. print o
<<<<++++. print comma
<.+ print space and increase by 1
>>>-. print W
>>. print o
>++. print r
<---. print l
<-. print d
<<<<. print exclamation mark

so full program would be :

++++++++[>++++[>+>+>++>+++>+++>+++>+++<<<<<<<-]>>+>+>->+>+>++<<<<<<<<-]>>>>.>>---.>++++..+++.<<<<++++.<.+>>>-.>>.>++.<---.<-.<<<<.
