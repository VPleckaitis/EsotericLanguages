Because to write hello world in ArnoldC is as simple as

IT'S SHOWTIME
TALK TO THE HAND "hello world"
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED

Let's do it a little bit more interesting - call method that says it

IT'S SHOWTIME
DO IT NOW SayHelloToMyLittleFriend

LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY SayHelloToMyLittleFriend
TALK TO THE HAND "Hello world!"
I'LL BE BACK SayHelloToMyLittleFriend
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED
